* Why do I only see R code instead of data files right now?
  - Wherever possible, there is code to download data from public sources and manipulate it for use in this project. The idea is to make reproducible data without generating new versions of existing files. 
  - Also, some of the data is BIG (like the water data) so we can't upload it here. We can give you the code we used to get it, though, so you can download it from the original source.
* Why are the spatial extents so large?
  - At the moment, we're working on downloading all the data we might need. We're cutting down the extents as much as possible to make the files run quickly, but we don't want to cut out something that we might need later.
  - These datasets will be cut down later using a common mask so that they all line up perfectly.
