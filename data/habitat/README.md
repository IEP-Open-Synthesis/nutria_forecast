* Why do I only see R code instead of data files right now?
  - Wherever possible, there is code to download data from public sources and manipulate it for use in this project. The idea is to make reproducible data without generating new versions of existing files. 
  - Also, some of the data is BIG (like the water data) so we can't upload it here. We can give you the code we used to get it, though, so you can download it from the original source.
